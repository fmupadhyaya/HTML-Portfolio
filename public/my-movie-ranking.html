  <h2>The top 3 classics that I love to watch again and again</h2>
  <hr/>
  <h3>Chupke Chupke</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>This is an classic bollywood comedy genre movie, which lifts my mood every time i have watched it. Be it the funny hindi words used by Dharmendra , or the comic timings in various scenes, with an amazing story line for the time it was released. </p>
  <br/>
  <h3>The Devil wears Prada</h3>
  <br/>
  <p>This is another classic movie with superb acting by Meryl Streep and Anne Hathway. The inspiration to progress with the world yet live the life on your terms is the lesson that I took from this movie.</p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Swades</h3>
  <br/>
  <p> A superb classic by Ashitosh Govarikar. One of the few movies of Sharukh khan that I love watching. Each scene in this movie is emotionally touching. It is the story of a NASA engineer returning back to his home country to find that its his own people who are beautiful by nature and need his learning to progress. It brings a feeling of patriotism to one's mind and heart and tugs at them, forcing me to reconsider what have i done for my motherland.</p>
